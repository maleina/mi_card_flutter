# Mi Card

## Our Goal

To learn more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## What I created

Mi Card is a personal business card. If you want to give someone your contact details or your business card but you don't have it on you, now you can get them to download your business card as an app.

## What was learned

* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out your UI
* How to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements
* How to add custom fonts
* How to add Material icons
